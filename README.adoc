= Example scripts for _NixOS_ /usr/local packages

Put source tarballs in the *src_tarballs* directory.

Packages are unpacked and built in the *srcdirs* directory, usually by
out-of-source (‘+VPATH+’) build. They are then ‘installed’ using
two-stage install mechanism.

Tarballs are made from the results and put in the *bin_tarballs*
directory.
